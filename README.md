Here are the steps to run:

**Step 1: Import Files into Eclipse**
- Open Eclipse IDE.
- Import the project files into your Eclipse workspace.

**Step 2: Install Required Dependencies and Configure Eclipse**
- Install the necessary dependencies:
- MongoDB Java Driver: Download and add the JAR file to your project's build path.(mongo-java-driver-3.12.13.jar)
- JavaFX SDK: Download and configure JavaFX as a library in your Eclipse project.
- Add these dependencies to the project's build path in Eclipse.
- Ensure that the paths and configurations are correctly set up.

**Step 3: Connect to MongoDB**
- Open MongoDB Compass.
- Create a new database or import a sample database if needed.
- Note the connection details (host, port, database name) for your MongoDB database.

**Step 4: Connect Eclipse to MongoDB**
- In your Java code within Eclipse, establish a connection to MongoDB using the MongoDB Java Driver.
- Use the connection details from MongoDB Compass to connect to the database.
- Implement code to interact with the MongoDB database as required for your project.

**Step 5: Running the Application**
- Run your Java application from Eclipse.
- Observe the application's output in the Eclipse console.
- Verify that your application can successfully connect to MongoDB and perform the desired operations.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up your Eclipse project, connect it to MongoDB, and observe the outputs in the Eclipse console as you work with the database.
